                        <li>Native american beliefs at the time, art.</li>
                        <li>Archaeologists and anthropologists claims that Americas were a 'new world' for Native americans too.</li>
                        <li>DNA evidence suggests that these ancestors paused—for perhaps fifteen thousand years—in the expansive region between Asia and America.</li>
                        <li>Other ancestors crossed the seas and voyaged along the Pacific coast, traveling along riverways and settling where local ecosystems permitted.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Northwest</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Native groups exploited salmom filled rivers</li>
                        <li>Agriculture arose sometime between nine thousand and five thousand years ago, almost simultaneously in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres.</li>
                        <li>Mesoamericans in modern-day Mexico and Central America relied on domesticated maize (corn) to develop the hemisphere’s first settled population around 1200 BCE.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Agriculture</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Agriculture flourished in the fertile river valleys between the Mississippi River and the Atlantic Ocean,aka Eastern Woodlands. There, three crops in particular—corn, beans, and squash, aka Three Sisters—provided nutritional needs necessary to sustain cities and civilizations. </li>
                        <li>Woodland areas from the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River to the Atlantic coast, Native communities managed their forest resources by burning underbrush to create vast parklike hunting grounds and to clear the ground for planting the Three Sisters.</li>
                        <li>When crops hard to grow, they move elsewhere. (letting initial farm regrow)</li>

                        <li>mothers often wielded enormous influence at local levels, and men’s identities and influence often depended on their relationships to women. better sexual and marital freedom than European culture.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Chaco Canyon and slavery.. kinda</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Chaco Canyon in northern New Mexico was home to ancestral Puebloan peoples between 900 and 1300 CE. As many as fifteen thousand individuals lived in the Chaco Canyon complex in present-day New Mexico.</li>
                        <li>Sophisticated agricultural practices, extensive trading networks, and even the domestication of animals like turkeys allowed the population to swell.</li>
                        <li>The Puebloan people of Chaco Canyon faced several ecological challenges, including deforestation and overirrigation, made smaller settlements</li>
                        <li>Cahokia was politically organized around chiefdoms, a hierarchical, clan-based system that gave leaders both secular and sacred authority. The size of the city and the extent of its influence suggest that the city relied on a number of lesser chiefdoms under the authority of a paramount leader. </li>
                        <li>War captives were enslaved, and these captives formed an important part of the economy in the North American Southeast. Native American slavery was not based on holding people as property. Instead, Native Americans understood the enslaved as people who lacked kinship networks. Slavery, then, was not always a permanent condition. Very often, a formerly enslaved person could become a fully integrated member of the community. Adoption or marriage could enable an enslaved person to enter a kinship network and join the community.</li>
                    </ul>
