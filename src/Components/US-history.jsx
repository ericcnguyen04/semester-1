                        <li>Archaeologists and anthropologists claims that Americas were a 'new world' for Native americans too.</li>
                        <li>DNA evidence suggests that these ancestors paused—for perhaps fifteen thousand years—in the expansive region between Asia and America.</li>
                        <li>Other ancestors crossed the seas and voyaged along the Pacific coast, traveling along riverways and settling where local ecosystems permitted.</li>

                        <li>Agriculture arose sometime between nine thousand and five thousand years ago, almost simultaneously in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres.</li>

                    <p>Agriculture</p>

                        <li>Agriculture flourished in the fertile river valleys between the Mississippi River and the Atlantic Ocean,aka Eastern Woodlands. There, three crops in particular—corn, beans, and squash, aka Three Sisters—provided nutritional needs necessary to sustain cities and civilizations. </li>
                        <li>Woodland areas from the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River to the Atlantic coast, Native communities managed their forest resources by burning underbrush to create vast parklike hunting grounds and to clear the ground for planting the Three Sisters.</li>
                        <li>When crops hard to grow, they move elsewhere. (letting initial farm regrow)</li>
                        <li>Analysis of remains reveals that societies transitioning to agriculture often experienced weaker bones and teeth.</li>
                        <li>Since farmers made the most food, new skills were developed: soldiers, religious leader, artists.</li>
                        <li>mothers often wielded enormous influence at local levels, and men’s identities and influence often depended on their relationships to women. better sexual and marital freedom than European culture.</li>
